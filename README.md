# qtcp-ns3

this is the implementation of the paper "QTCP: Adaptive Congestion Control
with Reinforcement Learning".

this repository is not maintained by the paper's author. It is just created because of my supervisor asked me to implement it in order to do our own peoject.

this implement is not accomplished. In fact, it just in initial phase. So you may feel disappointment if you are looking for a finished version of the paper's code. By the way, I have searched github for the author's code and send an email to the first author and the second author. However, I didn't get the code.

I will complete this repository in the futrue. However, It may be a diffcult task for me as I am an undergraduate who is not outstanding. Therefore, I don't konw when I can finish it.
